# CSC-340-IndAssignment02-DN


In this assignment I modified our rest-api demo that you supplied. I only modified the RestApiApplication.java class, since that is where the ravenPrice() method was,
now replaced with my nhlTeams() method. I did not change anything else that was in the rest-api demo as I thought we needed everything else in order to run the Spring 
framework. I apologize if you wanted us to make a whole new project without all the other rest-api stuff. I will do so in the future if that's preferred. As you can 
see, I also had some trouble pushing my code into a github repository(why my code is in a zip file) so I will come into office hours and figure out how to do this ASAP.
